# Prepare

## Project structure

Like most Fletcher projects, this example project contains software (host application) and hardware (accelerator functional unit) sources.

## Software

The host application consists of a single C++ source file that contains the host application that interacts with the accelerator. A CMake file is included that can be used to build the application. Instructions are available in the simulate and hardware sections.

## Hardware

The hardware directory contains a number of important files.

- `sv`
  - `ofs_plat_afu.sv`: this is the platform specific top-level that wraps the top-level generated by Fletcher
- `vhdl`
  - `Sum.vhd`: this is the sum kernel, taken (without modification) from the Fletcher project.
- `generate-input.py`: an example python script to generate an Arrow recordbatch file with some numbers that the accelerator will add.
- `sources.txt`: a list of sources that are used by the tools to discover the required files.
- `sum.json`: contains information about the accelerator that is used by the tools. The `accelerator-type-uuid` is used by the host application for discovery.
- `sum.mmio.yml`: a custom [`vhdmmio`](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/vhdmmio) input file. Needed because currently Fletchgen does not support generating compatible MMIO files for this platform.

The first step is to use [`fletchgen`](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/fletcher) to generate the required hardware to wrap the sum kernel.

Start by starting a new container from the root of the example.

```
cd fletcher-opae/examples/sum/
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/src fletcher_opae:latest
```

Generate an input recordbatch file using the provided `generate-input.py` Python script.

```
python3 generate-input.py
```

This script generates the `example.rb` file.

Then run Fletchgen on the mounted source folder.

```
cd /src/hw
fletchgen -n Sum -r example.rb -l vhdl --mmio64 --mmio-offset 64 --axi
```

Because Fletchgen currently does not support generating MMIO files for this platform run `vhdmmio` on the provided MMIO yaml file.

```
vhdmmio -V vhdl -P vhdl sum.mmio.yml
```

You can now `exit` the container and inspect the generated files.
